* 1NF (First Normal Form)

Each field must contain a *single, indivisible value*.

A field may *not* contain:
- a *set of values* (like a list), or
- a *nested record* (like an object with multiple fields).

To solve these problems, repeated or complex data should be *moved into a separate table*.

** Not in 1NF

*** Example: field containing a set of values
| ID | Name      | Phones               |
|----+-----------+----------------------|
|  1 | Juan      | 988887777, 977776666 |
|  2 | Francisco | 922223333            |

In this example, the =Phones= column contains *multiple values in one field*, which violates 1NF.

*** Example: field containing a nested record
| ID | Name      | Address                                       |
|----+-----------+-----------------------------------------------|
|  1 | Juan      | {street: "Mar 123", municipality: "Renca"}    |
|  2 | Francisco | {street: "Aldo 999", municipality: "Santiago"} |

Here, the =Address= column contains a *record (object)* with multiple fields inside — also not allowed in 1NF.

** In 1NF

*** Persons table
| ID | Name      |
|----+-----------|
|  1 | Juan      |
|  2 | Francisco |

*** Phones table
| PersonID | Phone     |
|-----------+-----------|
| 1         | 988887777 |
| 1         | 977776666 |
| 2         | 922223333 |

Now, every field has a *single value*, and repeating data has been moved into a new table (=Phones=).

This structure satisfies *First Normal Form (1NF)*.

** Summary (for dummies)
1NF = No repeating groups + no nested records + every field has one value.
